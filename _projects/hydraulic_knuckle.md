Hydraulic knuckles are hollow silicone bulb structures with tension handles on either sides manufactured using lost wax 
silicone molding process. A soft tubing is attached to connect the knuckles with a pressure control system. It is then 
covered with multiple layers of `LDPE (low density polyethylene)` sheets to prevent expansion during operation. 
The stiffness of the knuckles increases when it's pressurized with water.

The performance of these knuckles in their active state was characterized under tension and compression to study 
the change in stiffness with change in starting internal pressure. Refer to the
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121932">paper</a> for the details of the 
manufacturing process, pressure control circuit and the experimental setup and results.

Furthermore, to study the effect of interaction between the hydraulic knuckle and a rigid link over the 
rotational stiffness were studied at different starting internal pressures.
