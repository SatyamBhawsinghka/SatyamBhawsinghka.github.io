A `parallel underactuated tendon driven` gripper with `hydraulic knuckle` acting as `variable stiffness joint (VSJ)` was fabricated 
to study the effects of changing the joint stiffness on `grasp primitive` and `grasp strength`.  Refer to the
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121932">paper</a> for the details of the gripper fabrication, experimental setup and results.
