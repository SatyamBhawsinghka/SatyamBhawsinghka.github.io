Hi, I'm a roboticist interested in all things robotics at the intersection of design mechanisms, 
control and planning. I graduated with a master's degree in robotics from Oregon State University
where my research focused on developing innovative design mechanisms for enhanced dexterity 
and adaptability in robotic manipulation tasks using soft robotics under the supervision of 
[Dr. Joseph Davidson](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/joseph-davidson/)
while being a part of [Intelligent Machine and Materials Lab](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/davidsonjr/).

Currently, I'm working at [ViaBot](https://www.viabot.com/) as a Robotics Test Engineer where I develop automated 
testing procedures for hardware components (PCs, sensors, actuator mechanisms) and robot software for reliable on-field deployment
along with developing robotics software to increase robustness of our mobile platform [RUNO](https://www.viabot.com/gallery).

Previously, I have worked for Optum, UnitedHealth Group as an associate data scientist 
in the consumer analytics team developing targeted campaigns for customer retention in the 
healthcare industry using data driven solutions. 

I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi.
